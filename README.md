# AIRLINE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
This is a simple application in which you can manage flights data, see the details about the flights and the passengers who are aboard.
Done Using Java Swing,JDBC and MySql.Where user can able to see ongoing flights from one place to another and able to book flight tickets.

flights
This app will keep track of all the flights available and the specific route will display all the flights and on clikcing the flight you will be shown the details of that particular flight. Here we can even add passengers to a flight.

users
In this app users can login to check their details and the flights which they are on. Additionally they can even book flights from here. I implemented this to learn how authentication works in django.

admin
This is a route where you can login and see the data about all the models (Flights, Users and Airports) and you can add or delete certain data.

For simplicity I used :

username : admin
password : admin
so that you guys can check it out and add or delete data to see how the changes are shown in the website.
